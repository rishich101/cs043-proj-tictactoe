The design of our object-oriented Tic-Tac-Toe game will consist of using a class to represent the players and contain
functions that will allow the players to place their respective symbols in, as well as another class to contain
functions that create the game board as an object and give each of the 9 empty spaces as various attributes of the
board. There will also be multiple functions used in evaluating empty/taken spaces and drawing the board.The board
will be stored under a class. Each of the attributes that stand for the attributes of the board will be allowed to be
called upon as two letter combos (ex:TL for top-left,MR for mid-right,etc) by the players in order for them to be able
to place their symbols through a calling function.
